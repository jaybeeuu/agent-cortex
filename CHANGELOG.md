# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Agent rule: maintain `CHANGELOG.md` and update it in the same commit as any repository change.
- New `technical-direction` skill for collaborative technical design: challenges assumptions, derives constraints from codebase context, evaluates alternatives (including autonomous web research when needed), and writes decision memos to `docs/technical-direction/`.
- New `agent-cortex:strategy` agent that creates top-level design documents across vision brief (`docs/strategy/`), PRD (`docs/prd/`), and technical direction, with evidence-backed tradeoffs before `ralph-plan`.

### Added

- New `style-tests` skill: test writing style and conventions covering behaviour-over-implementation, sociable/integration-first testing (testing trophy), inline setup rules, factory patterns, no-hooks discipline, targeted assertions, mocking boundaries, and maintenance principles.

### Changed

- Skills updated to use `.agent-cortex/ralph/` as the working directory prefix instead of `.working-docs/` — affects `plan-to-epics`, `prd-to-plan`, `qa`, `record-idea`, and `ubiquitous-language`.

- `ralph` agent (agents/ralph.agent.md) now uses a chore-bead-per-stage model consistent with `skills/ralph/`. Each pipeline stage creates its own chore bead on-demand; `stage:*` tags live on chore beads, not on the parent feature bead. `state.json` inflight entries now track `choreId`+`parentId` instead of a single `beadId`. Loop counts (TDD loops, fix rounds) are derived from `bd children` queries rather than counters in state.

 Both the `run-beads` pipeline (ralph agent) and the `ralph` skill pipeline now create feedback beads on failure; the orchestrator sees them as ordinary ready beads and only needs to enforce loop caps before dispatching. The `fix` prompt templates (`run-beads/prompts/fixing.md` and `create-task/templates/fix.md`) now read required changes from `bd show <id>` rather than from injected REPORT content.



- Ralph now stores incidental orchestrator artifacts under `.agent-cortex/ralph/` (logs, progress snapshots, and state) instead of the repository root.
- Ralph, run-beads, and stage prompt templates now consistently point progress logging to `.agent-cortex/ralph/ralph-<bead-id>.log`.
- Git ignore guidance now standardizes on ignoring `.agent-cortex/` so incidental runtime files stay out of source control.
- Skills that generate non-repo working artifacts now target `.agent-cortex/ralph/` (plans, idea records, and ubiquitous-language glossary) instead of `.working-docs/` or `docs/`.
- `technical-direction` now requires a `References` section when external evidence informs decisions, including web URLs and code line-level references.
